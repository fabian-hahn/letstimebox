# About Let's Timebox

Let's Timebox is a distributed countdown timer, that can be administered from a central platform.

The participants get a random code that they can use to access their countdown via webbrowser.

We are currently in a very early stage so bear with us if you can't access your timer. At the Moment, 
Let's Timebox can only handle 100 concurrent users. But as we move forward, we might grow our server 
capacity.

## Who is behind Let's Timebox

Let's Timebox is a project by [Volker Gersabeck](https://twitter.com/thinkingux), 
[Silvan T. Golega](https://golega.de), and [Martin Gude](https://gude.me).

## Why did we create Let's Timebox

Martin prepared a distributed workshop and was looking for a distributed countdown timer but did not 
find a solution. So he told Volker about this problem and a few hours later Silvan, Volker and
Martin meat for a hack night and started to create Let's Timebox. Amd that is where we are now.
